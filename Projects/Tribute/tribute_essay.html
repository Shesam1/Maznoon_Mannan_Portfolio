<h2>Wonderland: A Journey From Childhood to Adulthood</h2>
<p>Children experience a turbulent period in their life as they transition from adolescence to adulthood where they question their place in the world, a concept that children’s literature perfectly captures. In particular, the novel Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland written by Lewis Carroll, depicts the main character Alice as suffering from an identity crisis due to puberty, in which she does not know what to define herself as; however, through her fictional journey in Wonderland she learns to accept the changes that come with growing older, thereby evolving her into womanhood.</p> 
<p>Wonderland, itself represents the effervescent nature of Alice’s mindset as she struggles to label herself. In the beginning, readers are given an image of a bored Alice who does not want to read her sister’s mature book, “what is the use of a book...without pictures of conversation,” reflecting her lack of understanding of the world of adults (Carroll 1). Alice uses Wonderland as an escape from growing older and as a way to retain the creativity that comes with childish innocence. Thus, Wonderland consists of impossible dimensions and strange environments when compared to reality; this also indicates Alice’s struggle to conform to societal rules for adults. The characters in Wonderland are all identified by a title and not by personal names, such as the March Hare, the Hatter, and the Queen of Hearts. Alice’s name as well, is used more as a way to delineate her as a character but not as a reflection of who she is, for she has not yet decided on that. The inhabitants of Wonderland stay true to their titles by confining themselves to one defining characteristic, the Hatter as mad, the Dormouse as perpetually sleepy, and the Queen as always chanting the same line, “Off with his head!” (58). Alice on the other hand, labors over finding a set category for her identity for she is multi-faceted, which can be seen in her encounter with the Cheshire Cat. The Cheshire Cat is different from the norm or as he states in his own words, “you see, a dog growls when it’s angry, and wags its tail when it’s pleased. Now I growl when I’m pleased, and wag my tail when I’m angry. Therefore I’m Mad.” (43). Anyone that does not adhere to societal standards is considered unnatural or in this case “mad”, constituting all of Wonderland and serving as a means to emphasize Alice’s own difficulties in fitting in and reconciling her childish nature with that of the burden of “adulthood” that will soon be placed on her.</p>
<p>Alice’s interchangeability and her efforts to conform as she grows old is best viewed in her constant change in size. Alice’s body continuously changes in size due to her feeling the need to follow the white rabbit or fit through a door. Her bodily transformations exemplify the stage of puberty a child goes through in order to physically become an adult. The process can be very confusing for kids because their minds have to suddenly mature to catch up to their physical maturity; in particular, for Alice as a young girl, her breasts would develop and she would abruptly experience the male gaze. Alice is left bewildered by these alterations, crying out, “I wonder if I’ve been changed in the night?...was I the same when I got up this morning? I almost think I can remember feeling different. But if I’m not the same, the next question is, Who in the world am I?” (8). Alice is afraid of these changes; she does not know her body anymore and thus she does not know herself. Her shifting of sizes also demonstrates her need to change herself to fit in with others and the world around her. She drinks these potions so she could chase others and traverse Wonderland; whenever she is too small or too big compared to the people surrounding her through, she feels uncomfortable and wants to become like them. However, by doing so, she loses sense of her identity.</p>
<p>Alice’s meeting with the Caterpillar illustrates her slowly developing understanding of her growth.  The Caterpillar persistently asks her “Who are you?” and Alice is unable to answer the question for she does not know who she is anymore, “I can’t explain MYSELF, because I’m not myself, you see” (29).  Alice is fearful of the changes her body has undergone, fearing her sexuality; puberty has matured her body into one that is womanly and suddenly men will view her as a woman and not a child, illuminated by the metaphor of the Caterpillar, which is considered a phallic symbol in literature. Additionally, Alice fears the mental deterioration of her memory, hence the Caterpillar tells her the story of Father William, who is far more youthful than his son, “You are old’ said the youth, ‘one would hardly suppose/That your eye was as steady as ever;/Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose--/What made you so awfully clever?” (31). The tale of Father William conveys to Alice that age does not define you, even when she is old, she can remain youthful at heart. Alice does not have to sacrifice her childish fervor and imagination that she used to create Wonderland, as she ages. Nonetheless, Alice is still not accustomed to nor satisfied with her development, “I should like to be a LITTLE larger, sir...I’m not used to it!” and most importantly the Caterpillar responds with, “You’ll get used to it in time,” (32). Alice cannot prevent her transformations; it is a fact of life that all living beings grow older. Similar to a Caterpillar, a creature at its beginning stages before it transforms into a butterfly, Alice is at her preliminary stages into full maturity; howbeit, through her conversation with the Caterpillar, Alice starts fostering an acceptance of the changes that come with aging.</p> 
<p>Alice’s growth into adulthood is epitomized in her rebellion against the King and Queen at court. The King and Queen of Hearts unjustly accuse the Knave of a crime based on silly and shoddy reasoning. Alice’s body grows back into its normal size, a size much bigger than the rest of the court but she is no longer bothered by that fact, “You’ve no right to grow here,’ said the Dormouse./ ‘Don’t talk nonsense,’ said Alice more boldly: ‘you know you’re growing too” (80). She now accepts her bigger body, symbolism for puberty and change, because she realizes that she is not alone in the fact that everyone grows older. This knowledge gives her confidence and power; she is not afraid to confront the King and Queen, “Hold your tongue!’ said the Queen…’I won’t!’ said Alice” (90). The moment Alice accepts her changes is the moment she finds her voice, the voice she needs to rebel and establish her own sense of identity. It is the moment where her name ‘Alice’ evolves to represent who she is and not a mere shell of her. Her acceptance allows her to leave Wonderland, a place that was once an escape from reality, thereby signifying her metamorphosis from child to Woman.</p> 
<p>Carroll’s novel Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland depicts the chaotic uncertainty that puberty is when an adolescent transitions to adulthood through Alice’s journey through Wonderland. Alice learns to tolerate the alterations that result from aging and her acceptance gives her power, leading her to become an adult. These transformative periods continue on throughout people’s lifetimes because with every age comes different responsibilities and the need to question one’s identity.</p>
