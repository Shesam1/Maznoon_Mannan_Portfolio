	<p>Listed below is the age you will be in whatever year you have chosen. Nothing special here. No magic involved, just indulging your laziness by doing the math for you. Congratulations, your brain can stay on the couch.<br />
	Honestly speaking though, you're not dead yet. Gladys Burrill ran a marathon at the age of 92, Teiichi Igarashi climbed Mt. Everest at the ripe age of 100 and Diana Nyad swam from Cuba to Florida when she was 64 years old.
	<br /> These three champions proved that age is but a number.<br />
	If you thought I was trying to make you feel bad about yourself, then you would be correct.</p>
